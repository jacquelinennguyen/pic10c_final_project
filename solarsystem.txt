Our Solar System

When we look up into the sky on a/an <ADJECTIVE1> summer night, we see millions of tiny spots of light. Each one represents a/an <NOUN1> which is the center of a/an <ADJECTIVE2> solar system with dozens of <PLURAL_NOUN1> revolving <ADVERB1> around a distant sun. Sometimes these suns expand and begin <VERB_ING> their neighbors. Soon they will become so big, thy turn into <SILLY_NOUN>. Eventually they subside and become <ADJECTIVE3> giants or perhaps black <PLURAL_NOUN2>. Our own planet, which we call <FIRST_NAME1>, circles round our <ADJECTIVE4> sun <NUMBER> times every year. There are eight other planets in our solar system. They are named <FIRST_NAME2>, <FIRST_NAME3>, <FIRST_NAME4>, <FIRST_NAME5>, <FIRST_NAME6>, <FIRST_NAME7>, Jupiter, and Mars. Scientists who study these planets are called <PLURAL_NOUN3>.
